# 🎲 Pig Game

A simple two-player dice game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
This project is part of Jonas Schmedtmann’s "The Complete JavaScript Course".

## 📜 Game Rules

1. **Objective**: Be the first player to reach **100 points**.

2. **Gameplay**:
   - Players take turns to roll a die as many times as they wish.
   - Each roll adds its value to the player's **current score**.
   - If the player rolls a **1**, they lose all points accumulated in their current score for that turn, and it's the next player's turn.
   - At any point during their turn, a player can choose to **"Hold"**, which means:
     - Their current score is added to their **total score**.
     - It's the next player's turn.

3. **Winning the Game**:
   - The first player to reach or exceed **100 points** in their total score wins the game.

## 🚀 How to Play

1. **Roll the Die**:
   - Click the **"Roll Dice"** button to roll the die.
   - If the result is not 1, the number is added to your current score.
   - If the result is 1, you lose your current score, and it's the next player's turn.

2. **Hold**:
   - Click the **"Hold"** button to add your current score to your total score.
